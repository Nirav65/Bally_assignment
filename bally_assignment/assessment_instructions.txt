Write a script to parse the attached projections file, and for each event in the file do the following:
	1) Organize the data according to the heirarchy diagram below
	2) Score each player with the given scoring system and assign them a "FantasyPoints" projection with the value. Change the display name for the stats to a formatted version of the represented stat
	3) Sort the players in each team by FantasyPoints descending

Output should be saved as a JSON file hierarchically organized as follows:

Events
	<Event Details>
	Teams:
		<Team Details>
			Players:
				<Player Details>
				Projections:
					<Player Projections>
				<Player Details>
				Projections:
					<Player Projections>
				...
		<Team Details>
			Players:
				<Player Details>
				Projections:
					<Player Projections>
				<Player Details>
				Projections:
